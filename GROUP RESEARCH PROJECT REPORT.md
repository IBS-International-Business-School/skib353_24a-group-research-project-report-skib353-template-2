## Introduction
Our project is about a shift to remote learning, accelerated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has reshaped the educational landscape, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Remote learning, characterized by virtual classrooms and digital tools, has enabled continued education during disruption. However, its impact on student performance has been a topic of significant debate.
While some students have benefited from the flexibility and accessibility of online learning platforms, others have faced obstacles such as limited internet access, lack of personalized instruction, and difficulties in maintaining engagement. These factors have highlighted the disparities in education systems and prompted questions about the long-term implications of remote learning on academic outcomes, skill development, and social interaction. This introduction sets the stage to explore the complex and multifaceted effects of remote learning on students' academic performance, considering both its benefits and challenges.

## Methodology
The study investigating the impact of remote learning on student performance employed a structured and systematic approach to data collection and analysis. Below are the details of the methodology used:

1. Research Design
The research utilized a survey-based approach to gather primary data from students, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods. This hybrid design allowed for a comprehensive examination of the impacts on academic performance, mental well-being, and engagement levels.

2. Target Population
The target demographic consisted of students enrolled in programs at IBS Budapest, ensuring a focused and relevant sample for the study.

3. Data Collection
Survey Design: The survey included a mix of closed-ended questions (e.g., Likert scales) and open-ended questions to capture detailed responses.
Distribution Channels: Surveys were disseminated through the Student Union email system and peer networks to maximize reach and participation.
4. Data Analysis Techniques
Descriptive Statistics: Utilized to identify trends and summarize key findings.
Correlation Analysis: Explored relationships between variables, such as academic performance and stress levels, showing a weak negative correlation (correlation coefficient: -0.34).
Regression Analysis: Analyzed the impact of engagement levels on stress, revealing a weak negative relationship (R² = 0.129).
5. Focus Areas
Academic Performance: Evaluated changes in performance, with students reporting declines (34.1%), no change (32.9%), or improvements (32.9%).
Mental Well-Being: Assessed stress levels, with 42% experiencing increased stress, while 24.7% noted a decrease.
Engagement: Measured levels of engagement during remote learning and its correlation with stress levels.
Technology and Environment: Examined students' proficiency in using technology and the impact of their learning environments on performance.
6. Limitations
The study relied on self-reported data, which may introduce biases.
The weak correlations observed indicate that additional factors likely influence student performance and well-being during remote learning.

## Results
The study on the impact of remote learning on student performance yielded several key findings, summarized across performance, mental well-being, engagement, and the learning environment.
1. Impact on Academic Performance
Declines: 34.1% of students reported a decline in academic performance during remote learning.
No Change: 32.9% experienced no change in performance.
Improvements: 32.9% reported improvements in their academic performance.
These results highlight a balanced split, indicating that the impact of remote learning on performance varies significantly among students.

2. Mental Well-Being and Stress Levels
Increased Stress: 42% of students reported increased stress levels.
No Change: 31.8% experienced no change in stress levels.
Decreased Stress: 24.7% noted decreased stress levels.
Feelings of Isolation: 58.8% reported feeling isolated at least occasionally, while 27.1% rarely felt isolated, and only 15.3% never felt isolated.
The findings suggest that mental well-being is a significant concern, with isolation and stress levels being notable issues during remote learning.

3. Engagement Levels
Low Engagement: 25.9% of students rated their engagement as low (ratings 1–2).
Moderate Engagement: 32.9% reported moderate engagement (rating 3).
High Engagement: 41.2% reported high engagement (ratings 4–5).
Engagement levels varied, with a substantial portion of students maintaining moderate to high engagement, which could influence their performance and stress.

4. Technology Proficiency and Learning Environment
Proficiency in Technology:
High proficiency (ratings 4–5): 82.4%.
Moderate proficiency (level 3): 11.8%.
Low proficiency (levels 1–2): 5.9%.
Learning Environment:
Students in conducive environments reported fewer distractions. Over 50% rated their environment as free from frequent distractions, while those in poorly rated environments faced more frequent interruptions.
5. Correlation and Regression Analyses
Academic Performance vs. Stress Levels:
A weak negative correlation (correlation coefficient: -0.34) was observed, indicating that improved academic performance is slightly associated with lower stress levels.
Engagement Levels vs. Stress Levels:
Regression analysis showed a weak negative correlation (R² = 0.129) between engagement and stress levels. Higher engagement slightly reduced stress levels, though other factors also play a role.


## Discussion
The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the multifaceted effects of remote learning on student performance, mental well-being, and engagement. Below, we discuss these results in the context of existing research and implications for educational practices.

## Conclusion
The study highlights both the opportunities and challenges presented by remote learning. While some students thrive in flexible and tech-enabled environments, others face barriers that hinder their success. These findings emphasize the need for inclusive, accessible, and student-centered approaches to online education, combining technological innovations with robust support systems to enhance learning experiences and outcomes.

## Reflection
The exploration of the impact of remote learning on student performance has provided profound insights into the evolving landscape of education. This study not only highlighted the challenges faced during this shift but also underscored opportunities for growth and innovation within the educational sector.
1. Personal Insights
Through the research, it became evident how diverse the experiences of students were. While some thrived in the flexibility offered by remote learning, others struggled with technological, emotional, and environmental barriers. This disparity served as a reminder of the importance of inclusivity in educational design.

2. Learning from Challenges
The challenges of stress, isolation, and reduced engagement were consistent themes. These issues reinforced the need for institutions to go beyond traditional teaching methods and adopt a more holistic approach to education—one that prioritizes mental well-being and fosters meaningful connections.

3. Role of Technology
Technology emerged as both an enabler and a barrier in remote learning. The digital divide remains a critical issue, but the potential of technology to enhance learning, when accessible, was also evident. This reflection emphasizes the importance of investing in digital infrastructure and literacy for equitable education.

4. Future Implications
The findings advocate for a blended learning approach that combines the flexibility of remote learning with the engagement of in-person interactions. This hybrid model could address many of the challenges while retaining the benefits identified.

5. Personal Growth
Participating in this research enhanced my understanding of educational systems and the impact of external factors on learning outcomes. It also fostered a deeper appreciation for the resilience of students and educators navigating unprecedented challenges.
