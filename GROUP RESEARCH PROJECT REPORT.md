## Discussion
One of the aims of this research was to compare our findings with pre-existing literature. However, it soon became apparent that past studies on the subject, particularly on the behavioral aspects of investors, labeled as ‘investor’ those entities that were either financial institutions or high-net-worth individuals, - the traditional market makers and movers. Our survey, on the other hand, targeted exclusively the so-called ‘retail investors’, individuals who may lack market influence on their own, but are a significant player as an aggregate. It is safe to assume that this would add value to our work. 

Some challenges included possible biases from the respondents’ backgrounds: the number respondents predominantly fell between the range of ages 28-36, very few being younger than 22. As a noticeable amount of respondents were non-Hungarian citizens, there may have also been some misunderstandings regarding the questions related to income in HUF. Other background data, mainly related to marital status, education, annual income, number of dependents etc., was surprisingly evenly distributed amongst the respondents. This made the following analysis more fair, but might also be an indicator of bias from the respondents’ background. 

The findings strongly supported our initial hypotheses: younger individuals were more likely to adopt riskier investment strategies (such as by investing in highly volatile assets like cryptocurrencies) and generally showed lower levels of financial literacy. Unfortunately, data on actual financial experience could not be used as a benchmark as most responses pointed at one to three years of investment experience, the latter being a potential substitute for financial literacy. 

Interesting enough, despite younger respondents generally having a perception of themselves as ‘risk takers’, as was proven by the data related to risk comfort levels, many questions that presented hypothetical scenarios regarding guaranteed low term losses (or gains) vs long term potential losses (or gains), were often met by younger investors with the most short-sighted response. This may show that younger people, despite initially opting for more volatile assets, may eventually quit their positions at the first hint of financial loss. This stands in clear juxtaposition to older investors, who, being more likely to pursue conservative strategies, tend to nonetheless opt for long term investments. This, too, supports our hypothesis that lower financial literacy is related to riskier investments.
