# Group Research Project Report
## Task Description

In this group assignment, your team will collaboratively conduct a **research project** based on either **survey research** or **A/B testing**. Your goal is to apply the empirical research skills studied in class and create a cohesive project report in Markdown format. You will work together using GitHub as a collaborative tool to document, analyse, and present your findings, adhering to lean/agile methodologies. The final submission should demonstrate teamwork, adaptability, and effective communication of your research findings and insights.

## Project Guidelines

You are required to:

1. **Select a Research Topic.** Choose between a **survey research project** or an **A/B testing project**. Your topic should be relevant to a business issue and approved by your instructor.
2. **Design and Conduct the Research.** For **survey research**, create a well-structured survey, collect responses, and analyse the data. For **A/B testing**, design an experiment, run the test, and analyse the outcomes.
3. **Collaboratively Document the Project on GitHub.** Use **Markdown format** to collaboratively edit the project report document. Your document should include clearly organized sections, tables, graphs, and other relevant visualizations.
4. **Apply Lean/Agile Methodologies.** Use GitHub’s collaborative tools (e.g., branching, pull requests, issues) to manage the project workflow. Incorporate Agile practices such as sprint planning, regular stand-ups, and retrospective meetings. Document how these methods were used to support the project.
5. **Synthesise and Critically Analyse Data.** Analyse the data you collect and critically evaluate the results. Discuss any biases, limitations, or challenges faced during the research.
6. **Communicate Insights Effectively.** Present your key findings clearly, using data visualization and effective storytelling. Focus on how these insights can be applied to a professional or business context.
7. **Collaborate.** Each team member should contribute actively to the research, documentation, and analysis process. Demonstrate adaptability and interpersonal skills throughout the project, ensuring balanced workloads.

## Deliverables

Your final submission will include:

- **GitHub Repository Link.** This must include all project files (e.g., code, data, documentation) and demonstrate your use of GitHub’s collaborative features.
- **Report in Markdown Format (2,000 words).** A comprehensive project report covering your research methodology, data analysis, and conclusions, all documented in Markdown format. Any charts, graphs, or visual elements should be embedded within the report and used effectively to support your findings. **The report file must also be uploaded to Moodle by the deadline specified.**

## Structure of the Report

Your report should be structured as follows:

1. **Introduction.** Clearly define your research question, hypothesis (for A/B testing), or objective (for survey research).
2. **Methodology.** For **survey research**, describe the survey design, sampling method, and data collection process. For **A/B testing**, explain the experiment setup, control/treatment groups, and metrics for evaluation.
3. **Results.** Present and analyse the data collected using appropriate statistical or analytical methods. Include relevant data visualizations and explain their significance.
4. **Discussion.** Synthesize your results, preferably citing other sources and authors; discuss the implications of your findings; and critically assess the research. Address any limitations, biases, or challenges faced.
5. **Conclusion.** Summarize the key insights from the project and suggest possible business or real-world applications.
6. **Reflection.** Briefly reflect on how your team applied Agile principles during the project and any challenges or successes experienced during collaboration.

## Submission Guidelines

- **GitHub Repository.** Your team’s GitHub repository link must be submitted through Moodle. **Ensure the repository is public.**
- **Word Count.** The main body of the report should be between 1,800 and 2,200 words, excluding code snippets, tables, and data visualizations. Reports outside this range lose 10 points from the final mark. Reports below 1,600 words are rejected.
**Deadline.** Please check the module Moodle page.

Your group project will be assessed according to the following criteria, which are directly aligned with the intended learning outcomes:

1. **Markdown Proficiency [20%].** Effective use of Markdown format for organizing and presenting project documentation. Includes structure, clarity, use of tables, lists, and code blocks (as applicable).
2. **Use of Collaborative Tools and Agile Methodologies [20%].** Demonstration of effective use of GitHub for collaboration, including branching, pull requests, and issue tracking. Evidence of applying Agile methodologies (e.g., sprint planning, retrospectives) and documentation of these processes.
3. **Data Synthesis and Critical Analysis [30%].** Quality and depth of data analysis. Ability to critically evaluate data and draw meaningful conclusions. Discussion of biases, limitations, and challenges.
4. **Communication of Data Insights [20%].** Clarity and effectiveness of communicating key insights, using appropriate visualizations and storytelling techniques. Consideration of how findings apply in a professional context.
5. **Teamwork and Collaboration [10%].** Evidence of effective teamwork, adaptability, and interpersonal skills. Balanced contributions from all team members.

The **resit arrangement** for the assignment is a 5,000-word individual research project report, as specified in the task description for the re-sit task on Moodle. The resubmission deadline will be specified on Moodle after the grades for the original submission are published.

## Academic conduct notice

**Harvard-style referencing** needs to be used consistently throughout. Incomplete referencing shall result in reporting the case to the Academic Conduct Officer, who keeps a record of such violations. First offenders may resubmit their papers and may receive 50% at most. Repeated violations of academic standards shall be sanctioned in line with the plagiarism regulations as detailed in the Student Handbook.

Where the Academic Conduct Officer has reason to suspect that a piece of work submitted by a student was wholly or in part written by someone other than the student who submitted it, and this has not been disclosed by the student, they may call for the student to defend the work in **a viva or a written comprehension test**. The burden of proof in such a viva or test will be upon the student to demonstrate to the examination panel’s satisfaction his/her full comprehension of the work s/he has submitted. Failure to appear without satisfactory explanation will result in immediate failure of that assessment, with consequences of academic misconduct and application of sanctions.

Permitted Level of AI: **Level 2: AI-Assisted Idea-Generation and Structuring**

- Permissible Use: You can use AI to generate ideas and structure the report but must write the final content independently.
- Documentation: You must keep records of the AI prompts and generated outputs.
- Disclosure: The use of ChatGPT for idea generation and structuring must be disclosed. For example, "ChatGPT 4.0 was used to brainstorm themes and structure for this essay on [topic]. Prompt: 'Suggest themes and an outline for an essay on international terrorism.' No AI-generated text is included in the final submission. Accessed: [Date]. Available at: https://chat.openai.com/."

## Retaining your data

Your examiners may wish to see your data while assessing and marking your project report. Such data might also be requested in cases of suspected academic misconduct. Therefore, you must retain a complete set of your raw data, including questionnaires (papers completed by hand or record downloaded from the online survey platform you use), recordings, and/or transcripts of interviews, secondary data that you used, etc., as well as data analysis files and documents. You must keep these, and must be able to present these if requested, at least until you are awarded your credit in the module. The different documents listed, including transcripts of interviews, do not need to be added to the paper itself, not even as an appendix.
